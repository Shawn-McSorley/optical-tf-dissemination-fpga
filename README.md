# Stabilised Optical Time and Frequency Dissemination using Digitally Enhanced Heterodyne Interferometry

This repository contains Verilog modules and example projects for use on the Red Pitaya FPGA as part of a research project on stabilised optical time and frequency dissemination using digitally enhanced heterodyne interferometry.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- `cores`: This directory contains Verilog modules that can be used as standard IP cores in Vivado. These modules include a CIC filter, a data logger, an NCO, a phasemeter, a PIG controller, a PRBS generator, and some other cores used for boilerplate logic.
- `examples`: This directory contains example projects that use the cores in the `cores` directory.
- `docs`: This directory contains documentation for the repository, including installation instructions, usage instructions, and an API reference.

## Installation

To install and use the cores and example projects in this repository, please follow the instructions in the `docs/installation_instructions.md` file.

## Usage

For instructions on how to use the cores and example projects in this repository, please see the `docs/usage_instructions.md` file.

## API Reference

For more detailed information on the API for each of the cores in this repository, please see the `docs/api_reference.md` file.
