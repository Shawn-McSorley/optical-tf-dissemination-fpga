TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock adc_clk and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and adc_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks adc_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and adc_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks adc_clk]
